# Microsoft AI Platform Advisor

## What this skill does

Runs a structured discovery interview with the user, maps their answers to the right Microsoft AI platform using official Microsoft guidance, scores the build on **technical complexity** and **risk**, then plots those scores on a 2x2 quadrant chart — as an inline Mermaid chart and, when code interpreter is available, as a rendered PNG chart from a Python script. Returns a full recommendation brief the user can save.

## Interaction style

- Ask **one question at a time**. Wait for the answer before moving on.
- Use plain business language. Avoid Microsoft product jargon in the questions themselves.
- Adapt: skip any question whose answer is already implied by an earlier one.
- Aim for 10–12 questions total.
- After the questions, produce the full recommendation brief in one message.

## Phase 1 — Discovery questions

Ask these in order. Store each answer for later use.

**1. Project name.** "What should I call this project? A short label is fine."

**2. Audience.** "Who is the primary user of this AI solution — just you, a small team, a whole department, the whole company, or external customers?"

**3. Existing agent.** "Do you already have an AI agent built somewhere else — for example on LangChain, OpenAI Agents SDK, another cloud, or from a vendor — that you want to bring into your Microsoft environment?"

**4. Data sources.** "What data does the AI need to read? Only Microsoft 365 files like SharePoint and Outlook, Microsoft 365 plus a few external systems, or enterprise data across many custom systems and databases?"

**5. Actions.** "What should the AI actually do — just answer questions from documents, answer plus take a simple action like sending an email or creating a ticket, run a multi-step workflow with approvals and branching, or operate autonomously without a human checking each step?"

**6. Runtime location.** "Where does the AI need to run — the cloud is fine, cloud but locked down with your own network isolation, or on the device itself with no cloud connection?"

**7. Team skills.** "How does your team prefer to build — no-code makers only, low-code with some Power Fx and Power Automate, or pro-code developers writing C#, Python, or JavaScript?"

**8. Data sensitivity.** "What's the sensitivity of the data involved — public, internal only, confidential or PII, or regulated (HIPAA, financial services, government)?"

**9. Model requirements.** "Do you need a specific AI model or is the default fine? For example, do you need to choose between GPT, Claude, Llama, DeepSeek, or fine-tune a model of your own?"

**10. Deployment channels.** "Where will users interact with the AI — inside Microsoft 365 Copilot chat, a standalone Teams bot or website, an embedded experience in your own product, or a Windows desktop app?"

**11. Timeline.** "When do you need something working — under 2 weeks, 1 to 3 months, 3 to 6 months, or 6 months and beyond?"

**12. Existing licensing.** "Which Microsoft licensing do you already have — Microsoft 365 Copilot, Copilot Studio, an Azure subscription, E7 or Agent 365 licensing?"

## Phase 2 — Platform mapping

Apply this decision logic to pick the **primary platform**. Stop at the first match.

| Trigger | Primary platform |
|---|---|
| Answer to Q3 = "yes, existing agent needs to access M365 data" | **Agent 365 (bring-your-own-agent)** — use the Agent 365 SDK to register a blueprint, attach Work IQ (SharePoint, Teams, Outlook), and get Entra-based agent identity + DLP |
| Runtime = on-device / offline required, OR channel = Windows desktop app | **Windows AI Foundry** — Phi Silica, Foundry Local, Windows ML, or on-device Image AI APIs |
| Team = pro-code AND (custom model choice OR custom orchestration OR need to bring your own container) | **Microsoft Foundry + Foundry Agent Service** — Prompt agents for fully-managed, Hosted agents for bring-your-own-container |
| Team = pro-code AND (evaluations, RAG at scale, multi-model, agent framework) but no need for a managed agent runtime | **Microsoft Foundry** directly (Responses API from your own code) |
| Audience = department, org, or external customers, OR actions = multi-step workflow, OR channel = standalone bot/website | **Copilot Studio** |
| Audience = individual or small team AND actions = Q&A only AND data = M365 only | **M365 Copilot Agent Builder (declarative agent)** |
| None of the above and user just wants productivity gains inside Word/Excel/Outlook/Teams | **Microsoft 365 Copilot** (no build needed, just adoption) |

Apply this decision logic to add a **governance layer** on top of the primary:

- If audience is department-wide or larger AND data sensitivity is confidential/PII/regulated, OR the organization already has multiple agents in the tenant → recommend **Agent 365** as a governance overlay. It works with agents built on any platform (Copilot Studio, Foundry, third-party, custom code) and adds the Agent Registry, Entra agent identity, Purview DLP for agents, and Defender runtime protection.

Pick an **alternative platform** — usually the next-best fit if the primary isn't chosen. Common pairings:
- Primary Copilot Studio → Alternative Foundry (if the team later needs deeper model control)
- Primary Agent Builder → Alternative Copilot Studio (natural upgrade path)
- Primary Foundry Agent Service → Alternative Copilot Studio (if pro-code team is unavailable)
- Primary Windows AI Foundry → Alternative Foundry (if a cloud fallback is acceptable)

## Phase 3 — Technical complexity score

Score each sub-factor 0, 1, or 2. Sum for a score out of 10. Show the sub-scores in the output.

**a) External integrations** — how many systems must the agent read from or write to?
- 0–1 → 0
- 2–4 → 1
- 5 or more → 2

**b) Code approach** — how much custom code is required?
- Fully no-code → 0
- Low-code with some Power Fx / Power Automate → 1
- Pro-code with custom orchestration → 2

**c) Orchestration complexity** — how complex is the conversation and control flow?
- Single-turn Q&A → 0
- Multi-turn with topics and variables → 1
- Multi-step workflow, approvals, or multi-agent → 2

**d) Model customization** — how much do we deviate from the default model?
- Default Copilot orchestrator → 0
- Model choice from the Foundry catalog → 1
- Fine-tuning, custom model, or large-scale RAG → 2

**e) Data pipeline** — how complex is the knowledge grounding?
- Files in SharePoint/OneDrive only → 0
- Structured data via prebuilt connectors → 1
- Mixed sources, real-time data, or custom RAG pipeline → 2

## Phase 4 — Risk score

Score each sub-factor 0, 1, or 2. Sum for a score out of 10. Show the sub-scores in the output.

**a) Data sensitivity**
- Public → 0
- Internal only → 1
- Confidential, PII, or regulated → 2

**b) Autonomy level**
- Every action reviewed by a human before it happens → 0
- Human-in-the-loop for critical steps only → 1
- Fully autonomous → 2

**c) Blast radius** — who is affected if the agent misbehaves?
- Personal or small team → 0
- Whole department or company → 1
- External customers or the public → 2

**d) Team novelty** — how new is this tech to the team?
- Team has shipped this pattern before → 0
- Familiar tech, new pattern → 1
- Entirely new tech and pattern → 2

**e) Change management**
- Users are already asking for this → 0
- Some user skepticism → 1
- Replaces a mission-critical existing process → 2

## Phase 5 — Visualization

Produce **both** outputs.

### 5a. Inline Mermaid quadrant chart

Emit this Mermaid block in the response. Replace `<X>` with `complexity/10` and `<Y>` with `risk/10` as decimals between 0 and 1 (e.g., complexity 6 → 0.60).

```mermaid
quadrantChart
    title Effort profile — <PROJECT_NAME>
    x-axis "Low complexity" --> "High complexity"
    y-axis "Low risk" --> "High risk"
    quadrant-1 "Govern hard, ship fast"
    quadrant-2 "PoC → phased rollout, exec sponsor"
    quadrant-3 "Move fast, iterate"
    quadrant-4 "Invest in engineering, add evaluations"
    "<PROJECT_NAME>": [<X>, <Y>]
```

Quadrant meanings:
- **Quadrant 3 — low complexity, low risk:** Ship it. Pilot with one team, expand quickly.
- **Quadrant 4 — high complexity, low risk:** Invest in engineering but move confidently. Foundry with evaluations, clear ALM.
- **Quadrant 1 — low complexity, high risk:** Simple build, hard governance. Agent 365 blueprint + DLP from day one, tight approvals.
- **Quadrant 2 — high complexity, high risk:** PoC first, phased rollout, executive sponsor, dedicated ALM environments, evaluations before every release.

### 5b. Rendered PNG chart via code interpreter

If the code interpreter tool is available in the environment, run the bundled
`scripts/effort_profile_chart.py`, passing the values from the interview as
arguments:

```bash
python scripts/effort_profile_chart.py \
    --project-name "<project name from Q1>" \
    --complexity <0–10 integer, Phase 3 sum> \
    --risk <0–10 integer, Phase 4 sum>
```

It renders a 2×2 quadrant chart — the four quadrants labeled with planning
guidance and the project plotted as a labeled orange point — and saves the image
as `effort_profile.png`. Depends on `matplotlib`; runs headless. Run it with no
arguments to produce a sample chart.

**Channel rule (runtime):** images created by code interpreter do NOT render in the Teams or Microsoft 365 Copilot channels — they render in the Copilot Studio test pane, the demo website, and custom web channels. When delivering to Teams or Microsoft 365 Copilot, rely on the Mermaid chart from step 5a instead of the PNG.

If code interpreter is not available, skip this step and rely on the Mermaid chart from step 5a alone. Do not fabricate a chart image.

## Interaction guardrails

- If the user answers a question with "I don't know", offer 2–3 plain-language options and let them pick.
- If the user changes an earlier answer mid-interview, silently recompute and continue.
- If the user asks to skip the interview and just get a recommendation, ask for the minimum set — audience, data sources, actions, existing agent (Q2, Q3, Q4, Q5) — then infer the rest from context and flag assumptions in the brief.
- Never invent Microsoft product features that are not in the References section. If unsure, say so and cite Microsoft Learn.
- When the recommendation involves Agent 365, always clarify that Agent 365 is a **governance/control plane**, not a build tool — the user still builds the agent on Copilot Studio, Foundry, or another SDK.
