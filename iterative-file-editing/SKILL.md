  Use this skill whenever you create or edit ANY file for the user in the Copilot
  Studio container — a document, spreadsheet, slide deck, code file, data export,
  anything. It keeps your work-in-progress durable and shows the user an updated
  version after every change, so the two of you refine the same file together
  across turns — the user sees real progress each round, earlier work is never
  lost, and neither of you has to start over. Apply it from the very first file
  you make.
---

When you send the user an updated version of a file you've **already** sent them,
give it a new filename with an incremented version number — `report_v2.docx`,
`report_v3.docx`, and so on. If you reuse the filename the user has already
received, the delivery event won't fire and they'll never get the update, even
though the file changed. A filename they haven't seen before is what triggers the
send.

So annotate each iteration with the next version number, and the user receives
every version as its own attachment.

## Example
```
report_v1.docx   first version sent to the user
report_v2.docx   the same file after "make the timeline more detailed"
report_v3.docx   after "also add a budget table"
```
