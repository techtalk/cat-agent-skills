# Skill: Data Scrollytelling

Turn an uploaded dataset (`.xlsx`, `.csv`, `.json`, or PDF tables) into a single self-contained scroll-driven HTML data story: animated Plotly charts, counting stat cards, and narrative chapters. Plotly.js loads from a CDN at view time.

## How to Talk to the User While Working

The internal workflow uses technical steps (SQL, JSON, HTML, Plotly), but **never expose that vocabulary in chat messages**. Narrate like a friendly analyst explaining to a non-technical stakeholder — plain language, short sentences, a little emoji. Never say "SQL," "JSON," "HTML," "Plotly," "dataframe," or "aggregation" in a user-facing message.

**Send a checkpoint per meaningful sub-step, not one per phase.** Phase 1 (inspect) and Phase 3 (aggregations) can each run 30–60+ seconds silently, which feels stalled — break them into several short updates as work happens. **Don't number them** (no `Step X/Y`); lead with an emoji and a short, plain-language title.

Example checkpoints (an illustrative full run — drop any line that doesn't apply, e.g. no time or geo column, and split a slow phase into more):
- 👀 "Taking a first look at your data..."
- 📐 "Found `<N>` rows and `<N>` columns — checking what each one means..."
- 🏷️ "Spotted your key categories: `<examples>`..."
- 🔢 "Counting up the totals..."
- 🏆 "Ranking your top performers — your #1 is `<top entity>`..."
- 🥧 "Breaking things down by category..."
- 📈 "Mapping out the trend over time..." *(skip if no time column)*
- 🗺️ "Plotting things out by location..." *(skip if no geo column)*
- ✍️ "Writing the story chapters..."
- ✅ "Your story is ready! Take a look 👇"

**Give ranking and chapter-writing extra beats** — that's where the user most wants to feel progress. Fold a real finding into the update (the actual #1, the size of the gap, the standout insight) with real names and numbers ("🥇 Sales leads with 3,120 hours saved..."), not placeholders. Keep every line short — a few words plus one emoji — and save the substance (findings, chapter takeaways) for the delivered story itself.

- `.csv` — via pandas
- `.json` — via json + pandas
- `.pdf` — extract tables via pdfplumber, then treat as tabular data
- Any tabular data with at least one numeric column and one categorical column

---

## Demo Mode

If the user asks for a demo, an example, or "show me what this does" without uploading a dataset of their own, build the story from the bundled workbook at `assets/Basketball_Demo_Data.xlsx` (runtime path `/app/skills/scrollytelling-data/assets/Basketball_Demo_Data.xlsx`) and follow [`references/DEMO-MODE.md`](references/DEMO-MODE.md) for the full demo workflow (sheet join, demo theme, ~5-chapter cap). If the user later uploads their own dataset, use that instead.

---

## The Five-Phase Workflow

### Phase 1 — Inspect & Understand the Data

Always start here. Never skip.

```bash
# XLSX flow only (CSV/JSON/PDF use their own inspect path, not this xlsx metadata artifact)
python /app/skills/analyzing-xlsx/scripts/preprocess.py <xlsx_file>
cat /app/workspace/_artifacts/<hash>/xlsx/1.0/metadata.json
```

**Sandbox file access — run the preprocessor first, every time.** In the Copilot Studio sandbox, uploaded files under `/app/uploads/` are gated: reading one directly with pandas/openpyxl (or `cd`-ing into `/app/uploads/` first) gets blocked before the preprocessing step has run. Always run `preprocess.py` against the uploaded file **before** any other tool touches it — that's what satisfies the gate and unlocks direct reads for the rest of the workflow. If a read gets blocked, the fix is to run the preprocessor, not to retry the same read or work around the block.

**Shell execution in this sandbox.** Some Python scripts in this environment need to be run through `/usr/local/bin/sandbox-exec` rather than invoked directly (e.g. `sandbox-exec python script.py <args>`). If a plain `python`/`python3` invocation fails or is blocked, retry it wrapped in `sandbox-exec` before assuming the script itself is broken.

Identify:
- Sheet names and row/column counts
- Which columns are **categorical** (names, types, states, categories)
- Which columns are **numeric** (costs, counts, scores, durations)
- Which column is the **primary entity** (the "who" or "what" — e.g. player, product, customer)
- Which column is the **primary metric** (the "how much" — e.g. revenue, quantity, score)
- Whether there is a **time column** (enables timeline chart)
- Whether there is a **geography column** (state, country → enables map)
- If the file has **multiple sheets**, whether they relate via a shared key
  (e.g. a foreign-key-style ID column) — this determines whether they need
  to be joined in SQLite before aggregating (see Phase 3)

Run SQL via SQLite to compute:
- Total count of records
- Sum/avg of primary metric
- Top N entities by metric
- Distribution of categorical columns (outcomes, types, categories)
- Monthly/weekly/daily aggregation if time column exists
- Geographic aggregation if geo column exists

### Phase 2 — Find the Story

Before writing a single line of HTML, answer these questions from the data:

| Story Beat | Question to Answer |
|---|---|
| **The Scale** | How big is this? Total count, total value, biggest single number |
| **The Where** | Is there geography? Which location dominates? |
| **The Who** | Who are the top performers? Who leads the ranking? |
| **The What** | Which category/type causes the most impact? |
| **The How** | Which method/tool/channel performs best or worst? |
| **The When** | Is there a trend over time? Spike? Seasonal pattern? |
| **The Worst** | What are the top 5 most extreme individual records? |
| **The Verdict** | What is the one-line takeaway? |
| **The Fix** | Given the data, what does the reader need in a closing chapter — takeaways, recommendations, external context, a benchmark? |

Each answer becomes a **chapter**. Aim for 6–8 chapters. Too few = shallow. Too many = boring.

**Plan once, then commit.** Before touching any code, write your final chapter list — for each chapter: its **title**, its **chart type**, and the **one-line insight** it delivers. Make every skip / merge / split / reorder decision *here*. Aim to settle this in a **single** planning pass; allow yourself **at most one** revision if something is clearly wrong, then the list is **locked**. Repeatedly re-deriving the story — re-counting chapters, reshuffling order, second-guessing chart choices — is the single biggest time sink, so do the thinking now and stop.

### Phase 3 — Prepare the Data as JSON

Extract all data needed for charts and inject it as a JavaScript constant in the HTML. This is what makes the file self-contained.

```python
import json, sqlite3, pandas as pd

# Load data
conn = sqlite3.connect(":memory:")

# Single-sheet / CSV / JSON: one dataframe, one table
df = pd.read_excel(path) # or pd.read_csv, etc.
df.to_sql("data", conn, index=False)

# Multi-sheet Excel: preferred live-workflow approach is to load EVERY sheet
# into its OWN table (named after the sheet), then JOIN them in SQL. This is
# how sheet-to-sheet relationships (e.g. a "transactions" sheet referencing a
# "customers" sheet by ID) are normally resolved. (A reference script may use
# a pragmatic pre-merge, but the runtime workflow should still favor SQL joins.)
sheets = pd.read_excel(path, sheet_name=None)  # dict of {sheet_name: df}
for sheet_name, sheet_df in sheets.items():
    sheet_df.to_sql(sheet_name, conn, index=False)
# Example: SELECT * FROM transactions JOIN customers USING (customer_id)

# Run all aggregations
summary = pd.read_sql_query("SELECT ...", conn)
monthly = pd.read_sql_query("SELECT ...", conn)
# etc.

# Serialize everything to one dict
data = {
    "total_count": int(...),
    "total_value": float(...),
    "top10_names": [...],
    "top10_values": [...],
    "monthly_x": [...],
    "monthly_y": [...],
    "categories": [...],
    "category_values": [...],
    "state_codes": [...],
    "state_values": [...],
    "worst_records": df_worst.to_dict(orient='records'),
}
with open("/app/workspace/story_data.json", "w") as f:
    json.dump(data, f)
```

Save to `/app/workspace/story_data.json`. Then build the HTML in a separate script that reads this file, so the two phases are independent and the HTML builder can be re-run without re-querying.

### Phase 4 — Build the HTML Story

Write the HTML to `/app/workspace/build_story.py` using the `create` tool, then run it with `python3`. Always write to a file — never use a heredoc with nested quotes.

**Build the chapter list you locked in Phase 2 — don't re-plan while coding.** Write the script in one pass that renders exactly that committed plan. Don't re-order, re-count, or reconsider chart choices mid-build; the scaffold below is a rendering reference for a plan you've *already decided*, not a prompt to decide again.

**Build every chart and animation through the shared helpers in this file** — `renderCategoryBar`/`renderDonut`/`BG`/`CFG` in the Chart Selection Guide, and the counter/leaderboard/record-card code in Animated Components — rather than re-typing traces per chapter. Each carries bug-fix rules (length asserts, single-fire counters) that keep charts and counters from silently dying. Only the **conditional** chart types (maps, scatter/bubble, dual-axis `yaxis2`) live in [`references/CHART-PATTERNS.md`](references/CHART-PATTERNS.md) — open it only when the data actually shows one of those shapes.

**Default story scaffold (a starting point, not a fixed recipe):**

```
[HERO]          Full-screen dramatic title + subtitle + scroll cue
[STAT SPLASH]   Animated counting stat cards (5–6 key numbers)
[CHAPTER]       Geography / where (choropleth map)
[CHAPTER]       Method / tool / type (bar chart)
[CHAPTER]       Category / what (horizontal bar)
[CHAPTER]       Outcomes / distribution (pie or donut)
[CHAPTER]       Timeline / when (dual-axis line chart)
[DIVIDER]
[CHAPTER]       Leaderboard — top N entities (animated rows + bars)
[DIVIDER]
[CHAPTER]       Worst/best 5 individual records (animated cards)
[DIVIDER]
[CHAPTER]       Closing chapter — takeaways, recommendations, news/context, or benchmark (AI decides which fits)
[EPILOGUE]      One-paragraph verdict + badge
```

This scaffold keeps you off a blank page. Keep the hero → stat splash → epilogue bookends almost always — they make it feel like a complete story. The chapters in between are **the plan you already committed to in Phase 2** — you decided there which to skip, merge, split, reorder, or add based on this dataset's strengths. Render that plan now in that order; don't re-open those decisions while writing.

**Chapter layout pattern (two-column):**

```html
<section class="chapter" id="ch1">
  <div class="c-inner">          <!-- text LEFT, chart RIGHT -->
    <div class="reveal">
      <div class="c-num">Chapter 01</div>
      <h2 class="c-head">Narrative <em>headline here.</em></h2>
      <p class="c-body">2–3 sentences. <strong>Bold the key insight.</strong></p>
    </div>
    <div class="chart-box reveal" style="transition-delay:.2s">
      <div id="cChart1" style="height:460px"></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</section>
```

Use `.c-inner.flip` to alternate text left/right between chapters for visual rhythm.
Use `.c-inner.full` for full-width chapters (timeline, leaderboard, worst records).

**Rendering contract — two rules that keep charts and counters from silently dying:**

1. **One `renderSection(id)` function, driven by both the observer and a safety-net.** Put all lazy chart/section rendering in a single named `renderSection(id)` function. Drive it from the `IntersectionObserver` **and** from a 2.5s `setTimeout` fallback. The observer alone is not enough — if it never fires (no scroll, reduced-motion, layout quirk), sections stay blank. The safety-net must do **all three** things the observers do — reveal, count, and render:

   ```javascript
   function renderSection(id) {
     if (rendered[id]) return; rendered[id] = true;
     if (id==='ch-map')  { /* Plotly.newPlot('mapChart', ...) */ }
     // ...one branch per section...
   }
   const sectionObs = new IntersectionObserver(es =>
     es.forEach(e => { if (e.isIntersecting) renderSection(e.target.id); }), {threshold:0.15});
   document.querySelectorAll('section[id]').forEach(s => sectionObs.observe(s));

   setTimeout(() => {                       // guaranteed fallback
     document.querySelectorAll('.reveal').forEach(el => el.classList.add('vis'));
     document.querySelectorAll('.num[data-target]').forEach(n => counter(n)); // counters too!
     document.querySelectorAll('section[id]').forEach(s => renderSection(s.id)); // charts too!
   }, 2500);
   ```

   **Dispatch on the SECTION id, not the chart-div id.** The observer watches `section[id]` elements, so `e.target.id` is the section's id (e.g. `ch-map`), *not* the inner chart div (`mapChart`). Match `renderSection` branches against the section ids or every branch silently no-ops.

2. **Syntax-check the generated JS with `node --check` before shipping.** One stray character — most commonly an unescaped apostrophe inside a single-quoted string (`'Chapter 06 · Who's Buying'`) — throws a `SyntaxError` that kills the *entire* `<script>` block, so *nothing* runs: blank charts and every counter frozen at 0. Escape apostrophes (`Who\'s`) and run `node --check` on the script before delivery. `scripts/build_story.py` does this automatically after writing the file.

### Phase 5 — Deliver

Write the file to `/app/created/` (per the File Naming Convention below) so it's returned as an attachment:

```python
with open("/app/created/<dataset-name>-story-YYYY-MM-DD.html", "w") as f:
    f.write(html)
```

## Chart Selection Guide

**Default to a small set of fast, robust charts** — these cover almost every dataset and rarely need bespoke math. Reach for them first and reuse them freely; **repeating a bar or donut across chapters is completely fine.**

| Data Shape | Chart | Plotly Type |
|---|---|---|
| Rankings (top N entities) | Bar (horizontal for long names) | `bar` (+ `orientation:'h'`) — `renderCategoryBar()` |
| Top-N with animated rows | Leaderboard | animated rows — see Animated Components |
| Share / composition | Donut | `pie` + `hole:0.55` — **max one per story** — `renderDonut()` |
| Two variables per entity | Scatter / bubble | **top ~10 entities only** — `renderScatterBubble()` — see `references/CHART-PATTERNS.md` |
| A metric over time | Line | `scatter` mode `lines` |
| A real geo column is present | Choropleth map | `choropleth` — see `references/CHART-PATTERNS.md` |
| Two metrics on one time axis | Dual-axis line | two `scatter` + `yaxis2` — see `references/CHART-PATTERNS.md` |

**Advanced charts (heatmap, treemap/sunburst, funnel, radar, sankey, waterfall, box/histogram) are opt-in only.** They cost far more per-run reasoning (custom normalization, pivoted matrices, per-axis scaling) and are a top cause of slow runs. Use one *only* when its exact precondition is met and a default chart genuinely can't tell the story — **never just to avoid repeating a bar or donut.**

**Scatter/bubble charts: plot at most ~10 entities, always.** A scatter of 20–30+ points is an unreadable clump of overlapping, mislabeled bubbles — pick the top ~10 by the size metric (or the story's focus) and plot only those, even if you hand-roll the trace instead of using `renderScatterBubble()` (which caps at 10 automatically). Keep the chapter copy consistent ("top 10", not "top 30").

Keep every chart readable on the dark theme (spread `...BG`, set explicit label/tick colors) and render it through `renderSection(id)` with a real `height` on the div. **Build all bars, donuts, and rankings through the shared helpers below** so the bug-fix rules (length asserts, ordering, low-variance zoom, no legend collision) apply consistently instead of being re-typed per chapter.

### Base Layout (`BG` / `CFG`)

Spread `...BG` into every chart's layout for dark-theme consistency:

```javascript
const BG = {
  paper_bgcolor:'#111', plot_bgcolor:'#111',
  font:{color:'#bbb', size:11},
  margin:{t:16, b:52, l:58, r:18},
  xaxis:{gridcolor:'#1e1e1e', linecolor:'#2a2a2a'},
  yaxis:{gridcolor:'#1e1e1e', linecolor:'#2a2a2a'}
};
const CFG = {responsive:true, displayModeBar:false};
```

### Category Bar — `renderCategoryBar()`

Charts like "resolution time by priority" (Low/Medium/High/Critical vs. hours) are a classic failure point: vertical columns misaligned to the category axis, or a category silently missing its bar — usually because each chapter's bar trace is hand-typed slightly differently. **Use one shared helper for every "category compared to a metric" bar chart**, never a bespoke `Plotly.newPlot` per chapter:

```javascript
// Generic helper for ANY category-vs-metric bar chart (priority, category, channel, region, etc.)
function renderCategoryBar(divId, categories, values, opts = {}) {
  if (categories.length !== values.length) {
    throw new Error(`${divId}: categories/values length mismatch (${categories.length} vs ${values.length})`);
  }
  // Pair, then sort/order once from a single source of truth — never build x/y as two separately-derived arrays.
  const order = opts.categoryOrder;                 // optional fixed order, e.g. ['Critical','High','Medium','Low']
  const pairs = categories.map((c, i) => [c, values[i]]);
  if (order) pairs.sort((a, b) => order.indexOf(a[0]) - order.indexOf(b[0]));
  else pairs.sort((a, b) => b[1] - a[1]);            // default: descending by value

  const cats = pairs.map(p => p[0]);
  const vals = pairs.map(p => p[1]);

  // Low-variance guard: zoom the axis instead of always starting at 0 (see "Low-Variance Rankings")
  const spread = (Math.max(...vals) - Math.min(...vals)) / Math.max(...vals);
  const floor  = spread < 0.15 ? Math.min(...vals) - (Math.max(...vals) - Math.min(...vals)) * 0.5 : 0;

  Plotly.newPlot(divId, [{
    type: 'bar', orientation: 'h', y: cats, x: vals,   // always horizontal: category on y, metric on x
    marker: { color: opts.color || '#ff5fa2', opacity: .9 },
    text: vals.map(v => opts.fmt ? opts.fmt(v) : v), textposition: 'outside', textfont: { color: '#aab' },
    hovertemplate: `%{y}: %{x}${opts.unit || ''}<extra></extra>`
  }], {
    ...BG,
    xaxis: { ...BG.xaxis, title: opts.xTitle || '', range: [floor, Math.max(...vals) * 1.15] },
    yaxis: { ...BG.yaxis, type: 'category', categoryorder: order ? 'array' : 'total ascending', categoryarray: order, automargin: true },
    margin: { t: 20, b: 50, l: 140, r: 60 }
  }, CFG);
}
```

Enforced rules: `orientation:'h'` with categories on `y`/values on `x`; `x`/`y` derived from **one** paired sorted list (never two arrays that can drift); categories never filtered independently of values; explicit `categoryorder`/`categoryarray`; and a length assert that fails loudly instead of rendering a phantom label with no bar.

### Donut / Pie — `renderDonut()`

**Use a donut/pie at most once per story.** If another column also tells a share/composition story, reach for a different shape (treemap, 100% stacked bar, funnel, or a plain bar) rather than a second donut. A donut's slices are already labeled directly, so **a legend is redundant and collides** (Plotly places it right, overlapping slice labels into tangled text like "In DevelopmentPiloting"). Never render a donut with both on-slice labels and a legend:

```javascript
// Generic donut for ANY category share/composition (status, type, segment, ...).
function renderDonut(divId, labels, values, opts = {}) {
  if (labels.length !== values.length)
    throw new Error(`${divId}: labels/values length mismatch (${labels.length} vs ${values.length})`);
  Plotly.newPlot(divId, [{
    type: 'pie', hole: 0.55,
    labels, values,
    sort: true, direction: 'clockwise',
    textinfo: 'label+percent',        // label the slice itself...
    textposition: 'inside',           // ...inside the ring
    insidetextorientation: 'horizontal',
    textfont: { color: '#fff', size: 12 },
    marker: { line: { color: '#111', width: 2 } },  // thin gap between slices
    hovertemplate: '%{label}: %{value} (%{percent})<extra></extra>'
  }], {
    ...BG,
    showlegend: false,                // ← the fix: no redundant, colliding legend
    margin: { t: 20, b: 20, l: 20, r: 20 }
  }, CFG);
}
```

If a slice is too thin for an inside label, don't turn the legend back on — merge tiny tail categories into an "Other" slice, or switch to a horizontal bar for many small categories.

### Low-Variance Rankings — When Every Value Looks the Same

Before building any ranked bar list (leaderboards, top-N charts), **check the spread**: `(max - min) / max`. If it's small (under ~15–20%, e.g. CSAT 3.98–4.08, or 94%–97%), a 0-based bar renders every row visually identical. Fix — pick one:

1. **Zoom the axis to the actual data range**, not 0. Compute `pct` as `(value - floor) / (ceil - floor) * 100` where `floor` is slightly below the min (or a meaningful baseline like a group average) and `ceil` slightly above the max. Default fix for leaderboard rows.
2. **Show delta-from-baseline** — plot `value − average` as a diverging bar (positive in `--fire`, negative in muted gray) instead of the absolute score.
3. **Switch chart type** (dot/lollipop on a zoomed axis, or a table with a per-row sparkline/tint) when a bar list still isn't informative.
4. **Never leave a 0-based bar as the only visual** for a low-variance metric.

State the actual spread in the chapter copy (e.g. "the gap between #1 and #10 is just 0.10 points") so the visual and narrative agree.

## Stat Card Rules

**Short numbers** (≤6 chars, e.g. `2,000`, `60`, `156`): use `.s-card` with `flex:1; min-width:220px`

**Long numbers** (≥7 chars, e.g. `$419,917`, `1,284,330`): use `.s-card-wide` — a standalone centered card on its own row with more horizontal space and larger font.

**Rule of thumb:** if the number has a `$` prefix AND is 6+ digits, give it `.s-card-wide`.

**`data-suffix`/`data-prefix` must be short and purely a unit** (e.g. `"M"`, `"%"`, `"B"`, `"h"`) — never embed prose, arrows, ranges, or multi-word labels in them (e.g. never `data-suffix="M tons"` or `data-suffix="→$4.17/kg"`). The 6-vs-7 char length check applies to the **full rendered string** — prefix + number + suffix combined — not just the numeric part alone, since that's what actually has to fit in the card.

**If a value isn't a clean countable integer or round decimal, don't force it into a counter.** A counter animates one number ticking up to a target — it can't meaningfully animate a range (`$3.61→$4.17/kg`) or a compound unit. When the raw stat is a range, ratio, or multi-part value, either display it as static (non-animated) text, or redesign it as something genuinely countable — e.g. replace "$3.61→$4.17/kg" with a "16% price increase" stat instead.

```html
<!-- Row 1: short numbers -->
<div class="stat-row">
  <div class="s-card reveal">...</div>
  <div class="s-card reveal">...</div>
  <div class="s-card reveal">...</div>
</div>
<!-- Row 2: large dollar amount gets its own wide card -->
<div class="stat-row">
  <div class="s-card-wide reveal">...</div>
</div>
```

---

## Animated Components

### Scroll-Triggered Counter

Add `data-target="12345"` and optionally `data-prefix="$"` to any `.num` element; a dedicated observer calls `counter(el)` when its card scrolls into view.

```html
<div class="num" data-prefix="$" data-target="419917">$0</div>
```

**Never start counters from the same IntersectionObserver that drives generic `.reveal` transitions.** That observer fires for every reveal element in the same batch, so a counter can start (or get skipped) while the card is still mid-opacity-transition — numbers race, stall, or never animate. Use two independent, single-purpose observers, and guard `counter()` so it can never fire twice:

```javascript
function counter(el) {
  if (el.dataset.counted) return;   // guard: fire at most once per element
  el.dataset.counted = '1';
  // ...existing animation logic...
}

// Visual reveal only — no counter logic here.
const revealObs = new IntersectionObserver((entries) => {
  entries.forEach(e => { if (e.isIntersecting) e.target.classList.add('vis'); });
}, {threshold: 0.15});
document.querySelectorAll('.reveal').forEach(el => revealObs.observe(el));

// Isolated counter observer: higher threshold so the card is substantially visible before
// numbers move, and unobserve immediately so it can never double-trigger.
const counterObs = new IntersectionObserver((entries) => {
  entries.forEach(e => {
    if (!e.isIntersecting) return;
    e.target.querySelectorAll('.num[data-target]').forEach(n => counter(n));
    counterObs.unobserve(e.target);
  });
}, {threshold: 0.3});
document.querySelectorAll('.num[data-target]').forEach(n => {
  counterObs.observe(n.closest('.reveal') || n);
});
```

### Leaderboard Rows

Rows slide in from the left one by one, then value bars grow right. **Check variance first** (see "Low-Variance Rankings"); if `top10` values are tightly clustered, scale from a zoomed floor instead of 0:

```javascript
const vals = D.top10_values;
const spread = (Math.max(...vals) - Math.min(...vals)) / Math.max(...vals);
const floor = spread < 0.15 ? Math.min(...vals) - (Math.max(...vals) - Math.min(...vals)) * 0.5 : 0;
const ceil = Math.max(...vals) * 1.02;
const pct = v => ((v - floor) / (ceil - floor)) * 100;

function buildLeaderboard(){
  D.top10_names.forEach((name, i) => {
    const row = document.createElement('div');
    row.className = 's-row';
    row.style.transitionDelay = (i * .07) + 's';
    row.innerHTML = `...`; // use pct(D.top10_values[i]) for bar width, not a raw 0-based ratio
    list.appendChild(row);
  });
  list.querySelectorAll('.s-row').forEach((r, i) => {
    setTimeout(() => {
      r.classList.add('vis');
      setTimeout(() => {
        r.querySelector('.s-bar').style.width = r.querySelector('.s-bar').dataset.pct + '%';
      }, 350);
    }, i * 90);
  });
}
```

### Record Cards

5 cards fly up from below, staggered:

```javascript
wrap.querySelectorAll('.i-card').forEach((c, i) => {
  setTimeout(() => c.classList.add('vis'), i * 110);
});

## The Closing Chapter — Decide What the Reader Needs, Don't Default to One Format

Every story needs a payoff beyond "here's what happened" — but *what kind* of payoff depends on the dataset and audience, not a fixed template. Add this as the second-to-last chapter, right before the epilogue, derived from **The Fix** story beat (Phase 2) — but "The Fix" is a prompt to figure out the right closing move, not a mandate that it's always a takeaways/action-item list.

**Decide which closing format actually serves this data. Common options:**

| Format | Use when... |
|---|---|
| **Key Takeaways** | The story's value is understanding — the reader mainly needs the 3–5 things worth remembering, no action implied (e.g. exploratory or descriptive data). |
| **Recommendations & Next Steps** | The data clearly implies operational actions the reader/organization can take (e.g. service desk staffing, agent coaching, process fixes). |
| **News & Context** *(requires web research)* | The topic benefits from grounding in current real-world events, industry trends, or external validation — e.g. market data, public health, policy topics — where showing "here's what's happening in the news around this" adds credibility or urgency the dataset alone can't. Only use this if the environment actually has web access; verify before committing to it rather than assuming it's available. |
| **Benchmark / How You Compare** | A credible public benchmark or industry average exists to compare the dataset against, and "are we ahead or behind" is the most useful closing frame. |

Pick one (or blend two, e.g. takeaways + one grounding external stat) based on what would actually be useful to *this* reader for *this* dataset — don't reach for "what to do about it" by default if the data is purely descriptive, and don't reach for takeaways if the data screams for action.

**Content rules (apply regardless of format chosen):**
- 3–5 items, each grounded in a specific number or finding already shown earlier in the story (don't introduce new *data-derived* claims here — external/news items are the one exception, and those must be clearly sourced)
- Keep each item to 1–2 sentences — this is a scannable list, not another narrative chapter
- End with a short closing line appropriate to the format (a "Next step" for recommendations, a one-line synthesis for takeaways, a source/date note for news items)

**Markup pattern (numbered cards, full-width — same structure works for any format, only the copy changes):**

```html
<section class="chapter" id="ch8">
  <div class="c-inner full">
    <div class="reveal">
      <div class="c-num">Chapter 08</div>
      <h2 class="c-head"><!-- headline matches the chosen format, e.g. "What to do <em>about it.</em>" or "What to <em>remember.</em>" or "What's happening <em>right now.</em>" --></h2>
      <p class="c-body">One sentence framing the closing format you chose.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="takeaway-grid">
      <div class="t-card reveal">
        <div class="t-index">01</div>
        <h3>Insight-driven headline</h3>
        <p>One sentence citing the specific number/finding (or, for the news format, the headline + source), plus why it matters.</p>
      </div>
      <!-- repeat for 3–5 cards total -->
    </div>
    <div class="next-steps reveal">
      <strong><!-- "Next step:" / "Bottom line:" / "As of <date>:" depending on format --></strong> One concrete closing line.
    </div>
  </div>
</section>
```

**If choosing "News & Context":** confirm web access works before committing the chapter to it (a quick test fetch, not an assumption), cite the source and date for each headline/stat pulled in, and keep the dataset's own findings as the throughline — external context should support the data's story, not replace it.

`.t-card` styling should match `.s-card` (dark card, `--fire` accent border-left, staggered reveal like `.i-card`). Number each card (`.t-index`) so it reads as a ranked action list, not a wall of text.

## Narrative Writing Guidelines

Good scrollytelling copy is short, punchy, and specific. Use this formula per chapter:

1. **Setup** (1 sentence): state the angle
2. **Specific finding** (1 sentence with a `<strong>` entity name): name the data winner/loser
3. **Implication or tension** (1 sentence): why does it matter, or what's surprising

**Good example:**
> The West leads on volume — its top teams post the most total points by a wide margin. But **efficiency tells a different story:** the highest points-per-game average belongs to a single standout player who quietly outscores every roster around them.

**Bad example (too vague):**
> There are many different teams. Some score more than others. The data shows interesting patterns.

Make headlines dramatic. Use `<em>` (styled with the accent color) for the key word:
```html
<h2 class="c-head">The margin<br>of victory <em>matters.</em></h2>
```

The epilogue should echo the hero's opening claim and close the loop:
- Hero: *"One Number Explains the Season."*
- Epilogue: *"The data is clear. The standings never lie."*

## Design System (Dark Neon Theme)

```css
:root {
  --fire:  #ff5fa2;  /* primary accent — headlines, numbers, bars (pink) */
  --ember: #a855f7;  /* gradient end — buttons, glow (purple) */
  --text: #f0ede8;   /* body text */
  --muted: #999;     /* secondary text, labels */
}
/* Background layers */
body        { background: #0a0a0a }
.chapter    { background: #0a0a0a or #0d0d0d (alternate) }
.chart-box  { background: #111; border: 1px solid #1e1e1e }
.s-card     { background: #111; border: 1px solid #222 }
```

Favor green, pink, and purple accents — they contrast well with the dark background. For a different mood, replace `--fire` and `--ember` and update the radial gradient in `#hero` and `#epilogue`.

---

## File Naming Convention

Lowercase kebab-case dataset name, the word `story`, then the current date. Example: `sales-data-story-2025-07-21.html`

Always deliver to `/app/created/` so it is returned as an attachment.

## Gotchas

| Issue | Fix |
|---|---|
| Large numbers clipped in stat cards | Use `.s-card-wide` for any value ≥ 7 chars |
| Content looks tiny with wasted black space | Increase chart heights to 460–500px; use `clamp(2.2rem,4.5vw,4rem)` for headlines |
| Donut/pie legend overlaps the slice labels (tangled text like "In DevelopmentPiloting" on the right) | The slices are already labeled on-slice, so the legend is redundant and collides. Set `showlegend:false` and label slices with `textinfo:'label+percent'`, `textposition:'inside'` — see `renderDonut()` above |
| Charts not rendering | Each chart div needs an explicit `height` in its inline style; Plotly needs a sized container |
| Blank charts AND every stat counter stuck at 0 | A single JS `SyntaxError` (often an unescaped apostrophe in a single-quoted string, e.g. `'Who's Buying'`) kills the whole `<script>` so nothing runs. Escape apostrophes and run `node --check` on the generated JS before shipping — see Phase 4 "Rendering contract" |
| Only the first chart renders; later charts stay blank | The lazy-render `IntersectionObserver` reports the **section** id (`ch-map`), not the chart-div id (`mapChart`). Dispatch `renderSection` branches on the section id |
| Charts/counters never appear until the user scrolls (or never at all) | Rendering is observer-only with no fallback. Route all rendering through one `renderSection(id)` called from both the observer and a 2.5s safety-net timeout that also reveals and runs counters — see Phase 4 "Rendering contract" |
| Nested quotes break the Python heredoc | Always write HTML builder to a `.py` file with the `create` tool, then run it — never use heredocs with nested single quotes |
| Chapters render before scroll | Charts are only initialized inside `IntersectionObserver` callback with a `rendered` guard object — never call `Plotly.newPlot` at page load |
| Leaderboard bars jump on load | Set `width:0` in CSS; only transition to final width after `.vis` class is added via JS |
| Ranked bars all look the same length (e.g. CSAT 3.98–4.08) | Values are tightly clustered — a 0-based bar hides the difference. Zoom the scale to the actual range (or a meaningful floor like the desk average), or plot delta-from-baseline instead of raw value. See "Low-Variance Rankings" above |
| A category (e.g. "Low") shows a label but no bar, or bars render as misaligned vertical columns instead of horizontal rows | `x`/`y` arrays are mismatched, misordered, or `orientation:'h'` is missing. Rebuild `x`/`y` from one ordered list of pairs and verify `trace.x.length === trace.y.length`. See "Category Bar — `renderCategoryBar()`" above |
| File too large to send | Avoid embedding Plotly.js inline (3MB+); always use the CDN script tag |
| Stat counters stall, jump straight to final value, or never animate | Counter starts were mixed into the shared `.reveal` IntersectionObserver batch and raced against other reveal transitions. Use an isolated, single-shot counter observer with a `counted` guard, decoupled from `revealObs`. See "Scroll-Triggered Counter" |
| Scatter/bubble log axis shows confusing repeating ticks (`0.1, 2, 5, 1, 2, 5, 10...`) | Set `dtick: 1` on any log-type axis so labeled ticks land only on powers of ten. See `references/CHART-PATTERNS.md` |
| Scatter/bubble is an unreadable clump of overlapping circles (dozens of points) | Plot at most ~10 entities — pick the top ~10 by the size metric and drop the rest, even in a hand-rolled trace. `renderScatterBubble()` caps at 10 via `opts.maxPoints`. Keep the copy consistent ("top 10"). See `references/CHART-PATTERNS.md` |
| Scatter/bubble labels overlap into unreadable mush in a crowded region | Don't statically label every point — greedily label largest markers first, skip a label if it collides with one already placed, keep full name on hover. See `renderScatterBubble()` in `references/CHART-PATTERNS.md` |
| Stat card text overflows/wraps (e.g. "105M tons", "$3.61→$4.17/kg") | The 6-vs-7 char rule applies to the full rendered string (prefix+number+suffix), not just the number. Keep `data-suffix`/`data-prefix` to short units only — never prose, arrows, or ranges. If the value isn't a clean countable number, don't animate it; show static text or redesign the stat |
| Dual-trace label collision (e.g. a bar's `outside` label and a scatter/line's `top center` label overlap at the bar top) | A bar chart and a scatter/line trace share the same x-position with labels pointing the same direction. Assign labels to opposite sides (e.g. bar `'inside'`, scatter `'bottom center'`) so the two never share the same vertical space. See `references/CHART-PATTERNS.md` |
| `yaxis2` overlay is invisible or its markers sit on top of the bars | Dark-theme axes need `yaxis2.color`/`tickfont` set explicitly (unstyled defaults to a dark-on-dark color); compute `yaxis2.range` from the overlay's own values instead of full auto so it doesn't collide with the bar heights. See `references/CHART-PATTERNS.md` |
| One giant entity washes out all color variation on a choropleth (e.g. one huge producer/exporter makes every other country look the same faint shade) | Detect dominance from the data (top value vs. 2nd-highest) and switch to a log color scale, or cap `zmax` below the true max — call out the clipping in the chapter copy. See `references/CHART-PATTERNS.md` |
| File read is blocked before any aggregation runs | The Copilot Studio sandbox gates direct reads of `/app/uploads/` files until the preprocessor has run against them. Always run `preprocess.py` first — see Phase 1 |
| A plain `python`/`python3` script invocation fails or is blocked | Retry wrapped in `sandbox-exec` (e.g. `sandbox-exec python script.py <args>`) before assuming the script is broken — see Phase 1 |

## Quick-Start Checklist

- [ ] Inspect the data — identify entity, metric, time, geo columns
- [ ] Run SQL aggregations — top 10, totals, distributions, monthly, geo
- [ ] Serialize all chart data to `/app/workspace/story_data.json`
- [ ] Write `/app/workspace/build_story.py` using the `create` tool
- [ ] Run `python3 /app/workspace/build_story.py` — verify "Done! X chars written"
- [ ] Syntax-check the embedded JS with `node --check` (build_story.py does this automatically) — a single bad char blanks the whole page
- [ ] Closing chapter — pick the right format (takeaways / recommendations / news-context / benchmark) for this data, 3–5 items grounded in earlier findings
- [ ] Stat cards: short numbers → `.s-card`, large dollar amounts → `.s-card-wide`
- [ ] Chart heights: minimum 460px per chart div
- [ ] Headline font: `clamp(2.2rem, 4.5vw, 4rem)` minimum
- [ ] Output file → `/app/created/<dataset-name>-story-YYYY-MM-DD.html`
